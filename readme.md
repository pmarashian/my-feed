### My Feed

The idea for this app is to display an aggregate of the selected feeds.  Users can modify the feed list and the app will update the view.

The app will use Firebase to store the user information.

Even though it's deprecated, we'll use the Google Feed API to get the items from each feed.

The app will need to combine the different feeds into one model, which will be displayed in the view.

User should be able to filter based on source, author, publish date and categories.

Entries will be displayed in a grid, with user adjustable widths.
